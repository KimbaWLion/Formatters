Wrote js_formatter.py and css_formatter.py

downloading cygwin to test them

Fixed js_formatter.py so that it looks okay

next up: eliminate all new random newline chars from the input

note: messy_css_file1.txt is not messy

-------------

Fixed js_formatter.py so that is removes newlines in the input code
Fixed js_formatter.py so that it adds spaces after ',' (unless it is in a quote)

Copied js_formatter.py to css_formatter.py (they are the same)

note: Ask around to see if complete

Created js_formatter_style2.py: same as js_formatter.py except it doesn't make a newline for '{' character.  
It adds a space before it and keeps it on the new line.

Creating html_formatter.py

Look into having a webserver to actually use this
